# Revenue Leakage Detector

A data science project to identify and analyze revenue leakage in large enterprises. This project helps finance teams detect hidden revenue losses from financial and transactional datasets through advanced analytics and machine learning.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Revenue Leakage Detector is designed to help large enterprises identify, quantify, and address revenue losses due to various factors, including:

- Missing payments
- Payment delays
- Over-discounting
- Duplicate invoicing
- Invoice mismatches

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Comprehensive analytics** of transaction data to identify leakage patterns
- **Machine learning-based anomaly detection** to flag unusual transactions
- **Interactive dashboard** with drill-down capabilities
- **Risk scoring** for customers and transactions
- **Time trend analysis** to track leakage patterns over time

## 💽 Dataset

The project uses a simulated transaction dataset with realistic billing patterns. The dataset includes:

- Invoice details (ID, dates, amounts)
- Customer information
- Payment tracking
- Discount information
- Leakage indicators

The dataset incorporates several realistic leakage patterns:
- Full payment (55%)
- Late payment (20%)
- Underpayment (10%)
- Discount misuse (5%)
- Duplicate invoices (5%)
- Missing payments (5%)

## 📊 Analytics Components

### SQL Analysis
The project includes SQL queries for analyzing revenue leakage patterns, including:
- Total leakage calculation
- Payment delay analysis
- Customer-wise leakage tracking
- Salesperson performance metrics
- Regional analysis

### Python Analysis
The `analysis.ipynb` notebook provides:
- Detailed exploration of leakage patterns
- Customer risk analysis
- Time-based trend analysis
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- Visualization of key metrics

### Interactive Dashboard
The Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard/app.py`) offers:
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Detailed leakage analysis by type
- Risk assessment tools
- Transaction search capabilities
- Filtering by time period, region, payment method, etc.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- SQL database (optional for SQL queries)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install required packages

streamlit run app.py
```

## 💡 Insights and Recommendations

The analysis provides actionable insights:

1. **Identify high-risk customers** who consistently experience leakage
2. **Detect patterns** in payment behaviors
3. **Quantify financial impact** of different leakage types
4. **Predict potential leakage** before it occurs
5. **Optimize collection strategies** based on customer risk profiles

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data processing, analysis, and visualization
